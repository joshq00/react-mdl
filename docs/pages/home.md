# React-MDL

React-MDL is a React wrapper for [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io), a set of material components maintained by Google.

This documentation is actually built entirely with React-MDL. You'll find examples of the available components.

If you want to experiment using codepen for example, you can find the React-MDL [bundle JS file](https://npmcdn.com/react-mdl/out/ReactMDL.js) and its [minified version](https://npmcdn.com/react-mdl/out/ReactMDL.min.js). Don't forget to include React and React-DOM for your demos.
